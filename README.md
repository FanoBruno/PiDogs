PUPPYS FUN CLUB

This repository is my first proyect. It is about this Dog´s Api (https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/breeds).
I have worked with JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, among others to develop it.
This project counts with a Landing Page that would redirect you to the Home page. At the Home page you would be avaiable of filter by breed, by size and by temperaments.
You can order alphabetically and by created or by dogs that are in the api. You can also add to favourites the breeds you like the most and also eliminate them from 
favourites if you put them there by mistake. 
You can also see a few more details of a dog if you touch his photo. 
You also can create your own breed by chosing a name, his minimun height and weight, his maximum height and weight, his life span and his temperaments.
You can delete a dog you have created in case you make a mistake or you don´t like it.
The project is paginated so you can navegate throw the pages. And last but not least you can search by breed. This search is not sensitive so it would match your search
with the closest match.
